# What It Does #
This project is designed to show modern simplistic web design with a Python backend. The site is for booking  rentals for a property and relies on saving and loading rental dates via a CSV file (a required limitation in the design document). The site also allows for reviews to be posted by people coming to the site, which are also stored in CSV format. A login system allows someone with admin access to remove reviews and accept or delete bookings from their respective pages.

# What I Learned #
* Server backend development in Python using Flask including loading files, routing to pages and input validation.
* Dividing work equally with a partner and knowing when to ask them for help (and when to help them).
* Implementation of simple JavaScript (including pikaday for calenders)
* Reinforced some CSS3 and HTML5 concepts learned previously such as flexbox, map embedding and CSS image carousel.

# Usage Notes #
To run, ensure Python 3 and Flask are installed on your machine of choice and navigate to the root of the project in your console. Use 'python ownSite.py' to start the server in development mode. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to see the site in action.
